# delete_node_modules


create a .sh file (name it whatever you like)

find the corresponding directory where you typically save your projects with tons of node_modules

save the .vbs file in your statup folder by pressing Window+R and typing "shell:startup". Now point the path to the .sh file, DO NOT SAVE BOTH FILES IN STARTUP
